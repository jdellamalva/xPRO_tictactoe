# Project Name

A simple tic-tac-toe game developed as part of the xPRO coding course.

## Description

This project is a command-line tic-tac-toe game implemented in [programming language]. It allows two players to take turns marking spaces on a 3x3 grid until one player wins or the game ends in a draw. This is adapted from a starter file made by Professor Williams.

## Roadmap

1. Clean up and modernize UI
2. Add functionality to reset the game once it ends.
3. Play a confetti animation using CSS when a winner is declared.
4. Fix winner/loser logic so that the game can't be continued but must instead be reset after a win/loss/draw event.
